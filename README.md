# Kotlin FP: Books Example

This project demonstrates the difference between doing a task in a typical Kotlin way vs using Arrow KT.

The purpose is to show how Arrow can simplify the code and separate IO operations from application logic. Some things in here are not Arrow specific; there are standard Kotlin collection operations being used as well (map/filter/reduce).
